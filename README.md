Hello there. Temida Shop is a simple only frontend application with a fake database. It was my first step with a learn typescript and redux-toolkit, the design is not perfect as I focused mainly on app logic :)

- User can add product to favorites and to the cart. Inside a cart component price of all cart items are calculated and re-calculated if new item appear or one of items amount increase/decrease. 
- You can choose item with your favorite color and size. 
- You can choose item with your favorite color and size. If combination of color and size isn't the same in the cart appear new item, but if is, you will only change  item amount in the cart.
